# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project currently supports security fixes on the `main` branch.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | ✅ |
| older commits/tags | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public issues for sensitive security reports.

Use one of these channels:

- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):
  - Repository → Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability
- Direct contact with the maintainer (`Ajimaru`) if advisories are unavailable

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Response Process

- Initial triage target: within **days**
- If confirmed, a fix will be prepared on `main`
- Coordinated disclosure is preferred until a fix is available

## Scope Notes

Security reports are especially relevant for:

- Shell command handling in `lmstudio_autostart.sh`
- Process control and command execution in `lmstudio_tray.py`
- CI/CD and GitHub Actions workflow security
